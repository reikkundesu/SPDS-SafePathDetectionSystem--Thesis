# SPDS-SafePathDetectionSystem--Thesis
Navigation Web App / Android App for finding the safest path.
This system was made using Android Studio with implementation of Mapbox API and DBScan Algorithm. The project was originally made for our capstone project.
The main function of this system is to create clusters using DBScan where the accidents frequently occur based from the data set acquired. The clusters will be represented by their centroids to represent their location on the map using X and Y coordinates. The navigation app will find a path that will avoid those points to get to the destination safely.
